Here, you can find 6 files which tell you all about our project. In order, they are:

Problem Statement:
> We address what we are trying to do, give any context that is neccessary to understand the project, and overall explain what we're doing.

User Stories: 
> Some goals that we want to accomplish, said in the form of "As a developer, ...". Kind of like in Jeopardy, where contestants have to say "What is ...".

Requirements:
> What is required for us to have done by the end of the project, similar to User Stories, but more "set in stone".

Architecture:
> Explains the architecture of our project and how we decided to get it done.

Design Document:
> Elaborating further on the design of our project.

Test Report: 
> Explaining how we went about testing our code (Spoiler Alert: it involves a lot of Minecraft).
