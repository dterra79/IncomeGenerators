# 1) As a developer, I want a block that looks like an arcade machine to have code to take me to an arcade game.
>**Elaboration:** Developers should code a way for an arcade machine block to start a game, whether that be through opening another app/window or making it appear in game.
>
>**Constraints:** Minecraft itself has some quirks that make this feature difficult to implement. 
>
>**Effort Estimation:** 10 person-hours
>
>**Acceptance Test:** That the game runs when clicked on in Minecraft. 


# 2) As a developer, I want Ensane Blox to be developed on a separate engine.
>**Elaboration:** Making a game within another games just introduces far too many obstacles that could be dodged if we developed the game in another piece of software. 
>
>**Constraints:** That Minecraft allows for a game to be plugged in in some way. 
>
>**Effort Estimation:** 2 person-hours
>
>**Acceptance Test:** That the game can be tested in any way. 


# 3) As a developer, I want the other games that we come up with to be fun.
>**Elaboration:** At the end of the day, the goal is to have fun with these games, both as a developer and as a user.
>
>**Constraints:** Humans.
>
>**Effort Estimation:** 5 hours
>
>**Acceptance Test:** That we have fun
