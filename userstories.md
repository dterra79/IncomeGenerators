# 1) As a developer, I want a block that looks like an arcade machine to have code to take me to an arcade game.
>**Elaboration:**  Developers should code a way for an arcade machine block to start a game, whether that be through opening another app/window or making it appear in game.
>
>**Constraints:** Minecraft itself has some quirks that make this feature difficult to implement. 
>
>**Effort Estimation:** 10 person-hours
>
>**Acceptance Test:** That the game runs when clicked on in Minecraft.
